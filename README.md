# Michael
This Michael Jackson, King of Pop, focused web application will allow those who access it to view a complete discography from Off The Wall through This is It. Viewers can access album details by era as well as song details by album. Michael, Forever caters to MJ fans who are able to, through our app, listen to some of MJ's greatest hits. On top of that, users will be able to recommend changes and additions to the application. Our developers created this application based on a common interest in the King of Pop and the idea of having a place to remember and celebrate him.
